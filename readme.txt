Maven
------

when adding a dependency to the pom.xml
1. put version number in the properties tag
2. put dependency without version in the dependencies tag
3. put dependency with version from properties in the dependency-management tag

Git
---
always push unfinished code to the working branch (not master)
when code is running merge to master.
this way we can work on multiple branches on different sides of code.
